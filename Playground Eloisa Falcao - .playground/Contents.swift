 # TEACH CONSENT
 
One of the ways to reduce the chances of sexual abuse, specially in children, is teaching about consentiment. When you talk about this you teach some very important skills to children, like asking questions, listening to what the other person has to say, and the most important: respecting the other person position, and you also helps the children to identify if others are acting without consentiment.
 
 Be honest on your choices, and enjoy the experience.
